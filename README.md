# get-mint-wallpaper
Some simple Bash / PowerShell scripts to retrieve Linux Mint wallpaper from deb files in repo ; this is generally intended for Windows 10 users with an installation of Windows Subsystem for Linux.  (This is just a practice exercise for myself to review Bash and learn PowerShell.... it might look strange to some people.)

Make sure that you have PowerShell for Linux in WSL installed, and then run "bash get-mint-wallpaper.sh" from the command line.
